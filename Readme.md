# Pen a friend

‚≠êÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è You should write letters ‚úçÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

**Pen a friend is an app which helps you ensure you keep writing to your loved ones.**

Most people prefer sending short text messages over writing letters. But some of us know how good it feels when someone writes to us! If you know that, this project is for you.

## How to use

Work is in progress. üöß Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yHFe3pMbay) to engage.

## Features

Use the app as a self-help for writing letters. Ideally, it should be natural. But we are humans and we often forget the good things we want to keep doing.

- Start using the app by entering how often you want to write.
- Pick a few names to begin with. Enter when was the last time you wrote to them.
- **The app will give you gentle nudges to write to a friend.**
- It'll tell you how long it has been since you wrote to someone.
- You can enable email notifications.
- You can enter a list of ideas you want to write about.
- The app doesn't care what you wrote. No privacy hassels. It's not a note-taking app.

## Reasons why you should write letters

- It's a healthier way to maintain relationships with people who live far away.
- It promotes thoughtful correspondences between two people.
- Receiving a letter can make someone's day. It's more personal.
- You'll enjoy looking back at your letters in the future, and remember how you used to be.
- It‚Äôs often more convenient than writing a text message. Letters give your thoughts and ideas a structure and efficiency in the way you express them. A certain extent of formality helps.
- Letters can be as long as you want. They allow you to express your ideas to someone, without having to adhere to a character limit.
- Your mood is lifted when you're writing. It's calming.
- Letters promote the use of artistic imageries to describe something. e.g. _I'm sitting in a park, I can see kids playing and it reminds me of ..._

## Some tips for writing letters

If you haven‚Äôt written a letter outside of your high school exams, these are some of the tips you can use.

- Email is a great way to send letters. You don‚Äôt need to go to a post office.
- The next time you want to send a message to someone about something you just read, learned or watched - think if this can be a letter. Ideas can be conveyed more strongly via a letter than a text message.
- Some people prefer to write in one sitting.
- Add some sincerity in the language. Do not use SMS abbreviations. e.g. use ‚Äúhave‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhv‚Äù, ‚Äúmessage‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmsg‚Äù, etc.
